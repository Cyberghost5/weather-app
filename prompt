Create a weather app that uses various videos of different weather conditions as background videos with the various weather parameters being displayed.

Use the current user co-ordinate using JavaScript to collect that information, and also create a space for a user to enter a specific location to display the weather for that location.
Use stock videos as the background videos and let them be on autoplay and looped.

Design the web app using PHP and use a suitable weather API to get the weather data.
